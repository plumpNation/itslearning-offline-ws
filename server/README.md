Self signed certificates
========================

These are self signed and nonsense and are used by the python server.py in the root folder.

The key passphrase is 1234. You don't need a key, but it does encourage you to read READMEs
you may find in folders...

You will need to tell the browser to accept the self signed certificate when you use this
certificate to serve files.
