Example 1
=========

## What is in the page?
1. A list of hardcoded news articles.
2. A CSS import.
3. A javascript file that outputs a simple console.info message.
4. A section containing news articles. Each article contains a
 * heading
 * *created at* datetime.

## What to do
1. Serve the example1.html page from your webserver in your browser (Firefox or Chrome?).
2. Use service workers to load the page and static assets.

## Service workers


## Trouble shooting
If your assets are not loading, please check the README in the root folder and check that your
webserver is running.

You will need to ensure that the paths to the static assets (css, js) are correct.
